# 2019 draft machine learning predictions

This repository contains the code and methods for each post analyzing the 2019 draft. Each post has its own folder with its own data, code, and graphs.

The first project is predicting the best scorers in the 2019 draft using regression models on shooting stats. It uses rookie and college data since the 1990 draft and projects PPG for prospects who played in college and are projected in the first round of [the Ringer's mock draft](http://nbadraft.theringer.com) (as of 6/15 update). It can be accessed in the "scorers" folder.
