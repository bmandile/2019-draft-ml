## 6/20: Predicting the best scorers in the 2019 draft with machine learning

The first project is predicting the best scorers in the 2019 draft. It uses rookie and college data since the 1990 draft and projects PPG for prospects who played in college and are projected in the first round of [the Ringer's mock draft](http://nbadraft.theringer.com) (as of 6/15 update). It can be accessed in the "scorers" folder.
